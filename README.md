I'm following along with this pygame rpg tutorial
by someone called 'Meloonatic Melons' on Youtube.

My files deviate a lot from the tutorial because I'm trying
not to use global variables and practice using classes, so
it's a little slow-going.

I haven't gotten to making a little protagonist character yet,
but the terrain builder map_maker.py is pretty cool when I
can get it to work.

I'm having issues accessing the tuples in my two-dimensional lists
of terrain coordinates though, which means my terrain isn't "refreshing"
as a new terrain with different painted textures.

But the window is definitely blinking a lot and the fps is really low?
So at least something's happening.

I know there's definitely multiple ways to access tuples from a list..
I tried the operator.attrgetter, and def `__getitem__`
but I don't think I followed through with either of them the right way?
Like fed my list in and got the outputs out correctly?

Stack Overflow people's explanations of list comprehension
were also a bit confusing, but hopefully will make sense soon.

Also I keep forgetting to make git branches lol.
