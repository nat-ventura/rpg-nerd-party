## pickle dump and pickle load will make this easier
## save data structures used for drawing---
## save textures and x, y coords -- coords of new terrain need to be saved
# dictionary with x, y coords and textures-- looking for "mouse events"
# data for where to draw new textures on top of blue grass-- capture which tiles-- needs to be stored in map file
# could use 2d array... tiles would be xy coords in a 2d array
